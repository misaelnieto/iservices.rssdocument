iservices.rssdocument: A dynamic RSS content-type for plone

This is a dynamic RSS content-type for plone. This idea comes from the
need to provide a simple content-type which will display RSS feeds
by using only jQuery, which is already available from Plone.

You will only need to add the RSS feed URL and configure how many
items to display. The jquery app will download the RSS fedd and show
it inside Plone. It uses the zRSSFeed jQuery plugin to do so.
